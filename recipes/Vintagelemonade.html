      <p>
        In the 1800's this is how people made lemonade—you can do it too! It's
        not that difficult, and tastes wonderful!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="ingr">
      <ul>
        <li>5 lemons</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¼ quarts water</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="steps">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut them into 1/2 inch slices.
          Set the lemons aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. Let this
          stand for about one hour, so that the sugar begins to soak up the oils
          from the lemons.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the hot
          water over the sugared lemon rinds. Allow this mixture to cool for 20
          minutes and then remove the rinds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a
          strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, pour into pitcher and pop
          it in the fridge! Serve with ice cubes.
        </li>
